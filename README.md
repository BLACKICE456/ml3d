## Indoor pictures in rigid transformation using Deep Closest Point (DCP)
We segment the objects in the images using a dataset, and we use DCP to solve the registration of the objects in order to estimate the pose of the camera.

## Prerequisites
- Python <= 3.9
## Requirements
>> - OpenCV
>> - Pytorch
>> - Numpy
>> - Go-icp (just for comparing)
>> - tensorboardX
